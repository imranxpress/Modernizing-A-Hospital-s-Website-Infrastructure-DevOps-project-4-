# Modernizing-A-Hospital-s-Website-Infrastructure-DevOps-project-4-
A guide for current or aspiring Cloud DevOps engineers on establishing an Hospital website infrastructure while leveraging DevOps best practices.

## Scenario:

HealthCare North is a regional hospital and they have recently encountered significant challenges when their sole cloud engineer resigned without notice, leaving no documentation for their cloud environment. The hospital’s static website is essential for patient communication and is currently hosted on an expensive traditional cloud server that incurs high costs and demands considerable administrative oversight. In light of these issues, HealthCare North seeks a more cost-effective and low-maintenance cloud solution that aligns with DevOps best practices.

## Project Overview:

The primary goal is to transition HealthCare North’s website from its current costly and high-maintenance cloud server setup to a more economical and efficient AWS service, specifically leveraging a static S3 website. This move aims to reduce costs and administrative overhead. Additionally, the hospital wants to establish sound DevOps practices, including a CI/CD pipeline with proper testing mechanisms, to avoid untested changes going live.
